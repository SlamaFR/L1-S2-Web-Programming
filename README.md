[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/441faa4118ce4a5fa83a9b4f96695139)](https://www.codacy.com/app/SlamaFR/Prog-Web?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=SlamaFR/Prog-Web&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This repository contains my work for the 2nd Semester of my 1st degree year.

## Important

The Codacy grade if pretty low because exercices forced me to use deprecated methods (such as `innerHtml += "..."`).

**The work is being uploaded almost weekly and after the semester finishes, this repo will be archived!**
